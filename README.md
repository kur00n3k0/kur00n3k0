# Hi there!

I'm just a cybersecurity analyst focused on Pentest, Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering and Threat Hunting.

I spend a lot of my time researching and refining offensive techniques, specially those that includes binary exploitation. I don't like web pentesting but no pentester can escape from that, right? :)

Look for me:

I’m seeking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects and hardware hacking. I am eager to learn about embedded devices and am an (not that much actually) active researcher in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). I am particularly interested in collaborating on low-level programming projects.

You can get some hint on some of my fav programming languages by this card:

**Writting things now!**

Take a look at my Medium page where i post my thoughts about programming and hacking: https://medium.com/@grapefruitcat

Also i have Brazilian Portuguese posts about Fully Homomorphic Encryption: https://fully-homomorphic-encryption-fhe.gitbook.io/intro-to-fhe
