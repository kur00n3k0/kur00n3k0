# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter and i'm a computer science student and Linux system administrator. In my free time i like to do some hardware hacking, contribute for malware analysis and look for some retro video games (i also hack them too).

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, hardware development/hacking and recently learning about embedded devices. I look to collab in any low level programming project.

That's the languages i use at most, but i'm always learning new programming languages. At the moment i'm learning Rust.
