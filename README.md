# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter, and Iâ€™m a computer science student and cybersecurity analyst. In my free time, I enjoy hardware hacking, contributing to malware analysis, and searching for retro video games (which I also hack).

Iâ€™m seeking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects and hardware development/hacking. I am eager to learn about embedded devices and am an active researcher in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). I am particularly interested in collaborating on low-level programming projects.

These are the languages I use most frequently, but Iâ€™m always learning new ones. At the moment, Iâ€™m learning Rust.
