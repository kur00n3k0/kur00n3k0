# Hi there 👋

My name is Peter and i'm a computer science student and Linux system administrator. In my free time i like to do some hardware hacking, contribute for malware analysis and look for some retro video games (i also hack them too).

I’m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, hardware development/hacking and recently learning about embedded devices. I look to collab in any low level programming project.

That's the languages i use at most, but i'm always learning new programming languages. At the moment i'm learning Rust.
